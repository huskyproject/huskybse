; Sample Msged TE configuration file
;
; On OS/2, DOS and Windows, you have to rename this file to MSGED.CFG and
; place it in the directory where MsgEd TE is installed.
;
; On Unix, you have to rename this file to .msged and put it into your home-
; directory ("mv sample.cfg ~/.msged").
;
; This sample configuration file is intended to give you a quick start into
; MsgEd TE 05. It does not want to be a full documentation. Hence, it does
; not cover all possible keywords and switches. For a full documentation,
; refer to the MsgEd TE manual.

OutputCharset IBMPC
;This defines which character set your mails should be converted to on save.

; F1 = Help menu

; Here is how you can manually define message areas (in case that MsgEd
; does not support the configuration file of the tosser that you are using):
;
; <format>  <area-type[msgattrs]> <"Area description"> <path> <tag> [address]
;
;   <format>         Squish | Fido | Quick
;   <area-type>      m .. netmail
;                    e .. echomail
;		     l .. local area
;                    u .. enable gateway features for this area
;                    8 .. write mails with CHRS kludge in this area
;   <msgattrs>       p .. private
;                    k .. kill/sent
;   <"description">  Description of area
;   <path>           Path to messagebase (or HMB board number)
;   [tag]            Echomail areatag; do not specify for non-echomail areas
;   [address]        FTN address to use for this area
;
; Some examples:

;Fido   mu8  "Intransit Netmail" e:\msgbase\intransit\
;Squish mu8p "Netmail Folder"    e:\msgbase\netmail 
;Squish eu8  "MsgEd Support"     e:\msgbase\msged   MSGED_ECHO 
;Squish eu8  "Test echo"         e:\msgbase\z99test Z99.TEST   99:1234/567.97

; Override BadMail-Area
Squish l "BADMAIL" /husky/echo/badmail


; Section 2 of this file covers settings that only make sense on certain
; ========= operating systems.

;First comes the huge bunch of UNIX specific settings:

IF UNIX  

  Switch Shadows Off
  ;Drawing shadows around dialog borders is a nice feature, but it costs too
  ;much time on typical UNIX terminal.

  Include ~/.msged.scheme
  ; color-scheme

  Template ~/.msged.tpl
  ;The template file defines templates for greetings, signoffs and footers.

  HelpFile ~/.msged.hlp
  ;This is a binary file containing the online help

  ;MountDir /bbsdisk E:
  ;If you install MsgEd on Unix, but your tosser runs on OS/2, DOS or Windows
  ;(supposing the messagebase is shared via Samba or NFS), your tosser
  ;configuration file (AreaFile) will contain DOSish path references (like
  ;E:\MAILER\MSGBASE\MSGED.SQD) that have to be translated to be useful to
  ;the MsgEd which is running on Unix.
  ;Suppose that the OS/2 PC running the tosser mounts drive E: from your Unix
  ;server. Everything that is stored on the E: disk will then be visible in
  ;the /bbsdisk subdirectory on Unix. If you specify "MountDir /bbsdisk E:",
  ;MsgEd will translate all filenames that it reads from the tosser config
  ;file that start with "E:" accordingly (the string "E:" will be replaced with
  ;"/bbsdisk"). It will of course also translate ;backslashes into slashes etc.
  ;For this to work, you must of course place the MountDir keyword *before*
  ;the AreaFile keyword!


  ReadKey 0x003E link_to    ; >
  ReadKey 0x003C link_from  ; <

  ;The standard layout of MsgEd assigns Ctrl+Right for jumping to the next
  ;reply to a message and Ctrl+Left for jumping to the message the current
  ;message is a reply to. These keys do not work on most unix systems. 
  ;Therefore, the two lines above assign the > and the < key to these
  ;functions.

;  EditKey 0x0004 del       ; Ctrl + D : Delete Character
;  EditKey 0x000e Down      ; Ctrl + N : Next line (one line down)
;  EditKey 0x0006 Right     ; Ctrl + F : Forward   (one column to the right)
;  EditKey 0x0002 Left      ; Ctrl + B : Backward  (one column to the left)
;  EditKey 0x0010 Up        ; Ctrl + P : Previous line (one line up)
;  EditKey 0x0001 gobol     ; Ctrl + A : Go to the beginning of the line

;  ReadKey 0x0001 first     ; Ctrl + A : First mail in folder
;  ReadKey 0x0005 last      ; Ctrl + E : Last mail in folder
  ;These keywords add some emacs feeling to the internal message editor ;-)

  ReadKey 0x4700 first		; Ctrl+Home	first msg in area
  ReadKey 0x4f00 slast		; Ctrl+End	last msg in area

  ReadKey 0x1400 config		: Alt+T		Setup
  ReadKey 0x006c list		; L		display msg list
  EditKey 0x3c00 quit		; F2		Save msg & return

  ReadKey 0x2500 view     ; Alt+K shows kludges 
  ;The standard MsgEd keyboard layout assigns Alt+V for toogline the display
  ;of kludge lines on or off. However, Alt+V kollides with the German Umlauts
  ;and therefore is disabled. The line above therefore assigns Alt+K to
  ;this function.


  EnableSC äöüßÄÖÜ
  ;If your Unix system is configured correctly (i.E. to use the ISO 8859-1
  ;character set), the parameters above should be the German umlauts: a
  ;dieresis, o dieresis, u dieresis, sharp s, A dieresis, O diereisis and U
  ;dieresis. If it doesn't, fix it!
  ;Normally, the Unix version does not allow entry of German umlauts and
  ;other special characters, because in VT100 they conflict which the Alt-key
  ;combinations that MsgEd crucially relies on. If you uncomment the line
  ;from above, you enable the input of these seven special characters. This
  ;is convenient if you are writing German text, but you will not be able
  ;to enter Alt+V any more - a fair compromise.
