# System alias file - try to fetch ftn-style aliases from there.
# If "from" address of a message from FidoNet matches _right_ side
# of some entry in sysalias file, then the Reply-To: header is created
# in the RFC message with the name part taken from the left side of the
# sysalis entry and domain part taken from myfqdn (below). E.g., if a 
# fidonet message comes from "John Smith of 1:234/567.89@fidonet" and 
# there is an entry in the sysalias file:
# "jsmith:	John.Smith@p89.f567.n234.z1.fidonet.org"
# and fqdn value is "pccross.msk.su", then the resulting message will
# contain a line: "Reply-To: jsmith@pccross.msk.su".

# If this is specified, beginning of the fidonet message will be scaned
# for RFC looking headers _only_ if the message is addresses to the name
# specified.  If not specified, beginning of all message is scaned.  I
# do not recommend specifying magicname unless you know that parsing
# headers will really break things.

# \D	untranslated telephone no. (send strings only)

# ModemPort present a blank-separated list of ports with possible speed

# PhoneTrans lines provide rules to change phone prefixes to make local
# or long-distance calls.  In the example below, my country code is 7,
# and local dialing area is 095.  From the numbers starting with "7-095-"
# the prefix is stripped and the 7-digit remainder is dialed.  For
# the numbers starting with "7-" but not with "7-095-", the country prefix
# "7-" is stripped and the long-distance dialing prefix "8W" substituted. 
# For the numbers not matching any of the above, international
# call is performed: international dialing prefix "8W10" is prepended
# to the unmodified 11-digit number.  Generally, the syntax is:
# "PhoneTrans <what-to-strip> / <what-to-substitute-instead>"
